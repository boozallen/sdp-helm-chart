SDP Deployment Helm Charts
--------------------------

To deploy the `Solutions Delivery Platform`_:

============================================================
Configure the chart by customizing the ``values.yaml`` file.
============================================================

**********************
``values.yaml`` Fields
**********************

::

  # default values can be found in values.yaml for global values
  # or charts/${subchart}/values.yaml for subcharts' values.

  # Note that anything set in values.yaml takes priority over
  # what's set in any /charts/${subchart}/values.yaml files

*******************
Configuring Jenkins
*******************

++++++++++++++++++++++
Credentials (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++

While the installation process automatically creates and stores the credentials
necessary for most users, you can set additional credentials you want available
to Jenkins. These can be credentials for different GitHub users, artifact
repositories, or services you wish to use as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Any credentials you list here are automatically added to the Jenkins credential
store.

::

  jenkins:
    credentials:
    - id:        Required. Unique name for the credential by which it can be referenced
      username:  Required. The username for the credential
      password:  Required. The password for the credential
    - ... (multiple can be defined)

The credentials that are created automatically (**and should not be listed in the values file**) are:

* github: the GitHub credential supplied by the user during the installation
* openshift-service-account: the credentials for the jenkins ServiceAccount that Jenkins uses to authenticate to Openshift
* openshift-docker-registry: the same as above, but in a more convenient username/password format; use this for the sdp and docker SDP libraries
* sonarqube: credentials for interfacing w/ the Sonarqube server deployed alongside Jenkins

++++++++++++++++++++
Resources (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++

Set the CPU and memory guarantees and limits. The requests ensure that containers
get adequate computing resources on whichever node they're scheduled on,
while the limits ensure containers are restarted and rescheduled should they begin
consuming too many resources. Together, this ensures quality of service for Jenkins
and the other containers on the cluster.

Note that you shouldn't need to configure this in order to set up SDP, as sensible
defaults have already been set.

More information on resource requests and limits can be found on the `Kubernetes website`_,
but note that users are currently restricted to placing requests and limits on cpu and memory.


::

  jenkins:
    resources:
      master:               Values for the Jenkins Master
        limits:             The resources the container can use before being evicted
          cpu:              Cpu limit
          memory:           Memory limit
        requests:           The node's necessary resources for a container to be scheduled
          cpu:              Requested CPUs
          memory:           Requested memory
      agent:                Values for the Jenkins Agent (structure same as above)
        limits:             The resources the container can use before being evicted
          cpu:              Cpu limit

          cpu:              Requested CPUs
          memory:           Requested memory

  sonarqube:
    resources:             Values for the Sonarqube container
      limits:              The resources the container can use before being evicted
        cpu:               Cpu limit
        memory:            Memory limit
      requests:            The resources a node must have available before the container can be scheduled

========================
Run the Installer Script
========================

From your terminal, login to Openshift as a cluster-admin and run the installer
script.

.. code:: shell

    ./installer.sh

Supply a GitHub username and password (or access token) when prompted.

************************
Installer Script Options
************************

Run ``./installer.sh -h`` to view the installer script's options.
